# Frontend Orchestrator

Coordinates all frontend-related development tasks by routing to the appropriate specialist sub-agent based on the current action or user selection.

## Sub-agents

| File                           | Responsibility                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [developer.md](./developer.md) | Implement UI features and fixes across the `www/` multi-brand frontend                                      |
| [quality.md](./quality.md)     | Run Prettier, ESLint, Typecheck, and Build across all `www/` projects; loop until all pass                  |
| [reviewer.md](./reviewer.md)   | Review frontend code changes for correctness, brand isolation, accessibility, and quality before committing |
| [test.md](./test.md)           | Run Jest tests across all `www/` projects; loop until all suites pass                                       |

## Startup

**On every load, before showing any menu, read the `action` key from the session:**

```bash
node .a-local-workflow/workflow/scripts/session/session.js get action
```

- If `action` is `"develop"` → load [developer.md](./developer.md) and follow its steps.
- If `action` is `"quality-check"` → load [quality.md](./quality.md) and follow its steps.
- If `action` is `"review"` → load [reviewer.md](./reviewer.md) and follow its steps.
- If `action` is `"test"` → load [test.md](./test.md) and follow its steps.
- If `action` is empty or absent → continue to the **Startup Menu** below.

## Startup Menu

**When no `action` is set, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool before doing anything else.**

```
- question: "What would you like to do?"

  2. label "Quality checks"    — description "Run Prettier, ESLint, Typecheck, and Build across all www/ projects"   — action "quality-check"
  3. label "Review code"       — description "Review frontend changes for correctness, brand isolation, and quality"  — action "review"
  4. label "Run tests"         — description "Run Jest unit/component tests across all www/ projects"                — action "test"
